    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The Lorenz delta RepRap design is named after Konrad Lorenz.<br>
      There is nothing majorly innovative about it, but it was designed with the
      following in mind:<br>
      Few trailing wires - they are buried in the prints wherever possible<br>
      Generic axis that can work for a delta or Cartesian design<br>
      No timing belts - the drives are fine wires coiled on smooth pulleys<br>
      No bearings - or rather printed bearings running on PTFE sliders made from
      Bowden tube<br>
      Hollow axis rods to allow services to run up the middle of them (including
      the Bowden tube)<br>
      Axis rods used also as electrical connections<br>
      Adjust, clamp, then glue to get accuracy in the dimensions of the machine<br>
      and<br>
      Almost all fixing screws are self-tapping, so few nuts</p>
